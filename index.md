## Unique Features of Upper Inlet

Upper Inlet differs from other Dena'ina varieties in that there is no contrast between the sounds <b>dz</b>~<b>j</b>, <b>ts</b>~<b>ch</b>, <b>ts'</b>~<b>ch'</b>, and <b>s</b>~<b>sh</b>. However, these sounds are usually written as they would be pronounced in the other dialects. For example, the words <b>shan</b> 'summer' and <b>san</b> 'stand' have roughly the same pronunciation in Upper Inlet, beginning with a sound somewhere between <b>sh</b> and <b>s</b>. These letters which are pronounced alike in Upper Inlet are grouped together in the keywords.
