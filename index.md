## Upper Inlet Dena’ina and This Project

The Upper Inlet dialect of Dena’ina is the traditional language of the
Upper Cook Inlet Basin, including at the communities of Tyonek,
Knik, and Eklutna. 

## A Message from Sava Stephan


Dach'u shughu dach'u henach'delghesh q'udu. Niłnuch'qelnek ni'eł henach'delgheshi shi't'i. Dena'inaq' nayna qadaniłdetnesh ch'u gu qa qeshnash dit.

This here is how we speak. We can tell stories to one another and speak to one another. I say this so that we can understand each other in the Dena'ina language.


Sava Stephan was born in 1920 in Susitna Station. Sava grew up speaking the Dena’ina language. He moved to Tyonek in 1934 along with most of the residents of Susitna Station. Sava has worked and traveled throughout the Susitna and Tyonek areas, and today he is the recognized expert on Upper Inlet Dena’ina.
